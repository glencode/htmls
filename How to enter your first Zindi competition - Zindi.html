Data</h3><p></p><div class="image">
<img src="./How to enter your first Zindi competition - Zindi_files/4ecc2bfd-3139-4b07-8af5-7b01fc8993e5.png"> </div><p></p><p>The data tab contains a description of the dataset you are going to use for this competition. On the right side of the page, you can see a list of links to download the dataset and other important files. You will download:</p><ul class="public-DraftStyleDefault-ul">
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="">VariableDefinition.csv </span>— This file contains a definition of each variable in the train and test data.</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="">SubmissionFile.csv </span>— The file contains a sample of how the submission file should look like.</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="">Test_v2.csv</span> — This is a test data file you will use for prediction and save your results in the submission file.</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="">Train._v2.cs - </span>This is a train data file that contains both the independent variable and the target one. You will use this dataset to train your model.</li>
</ul><p>These files may differ between competitions. Also, keep in mind that you must join the competition in order to have access to the data files.</p><h3>3. Discussion</h3><p></p><div class="image">

That is the <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="">purpose</span> of the discussion page, you don’t need to walk alone throughout the competition. If you face any challenge or uncertainty during the competition or you want to ask a question to understand more about the dataset provided, you can post on the discussion page and other data scientists enrolled in the competition can help you to solve the problem.</p><p>The discussion board is very active and full of knowledgeable and helpful African data scientists willing to assist you.</p><h3>4. Leaderboard</h3><p></p><div class="image">

You can create a team with fellow data scientists enrolled in the competition and work together. The maximum number for a team is 4 members. Remember that sharing code between individuals is not allowed, so if you want to share code with someone else, they must be on the same team as you.</p><h3>6. Submission</h3><p></p><div class="image">
